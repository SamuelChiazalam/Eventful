## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: The following changes may require action:

1. **Payment Index Fix**: Database automatic cleanup runs on startup. Existing problematic indexes will be removed.
   - No action needed - happens automatically
   - Monitor logs for confirmation

2. **PATCH vs PUT for Reminders**: Endpoint changed from PUT to PATCH
   - Front-end code already updated
   - If using external clients, update requests to use PATCH

3. **New Required Environment Variables**: `FRONTEND_URL` now used by payment system
   - All variables listed in updated .env.example
   - Add to deployment configuration

---

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Version

1. **Database Cleanup** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run db:cleanup
   ```
   This will:
   - Remove any duplicate indexes
   - Clean up old pending payments
   - Reset stuck transactions

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly
   - Other variables unchanged

3. **Frontend Build**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **No Data Migration Needed**: All changes are backward compatible

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Free Tier Render Services**: May experience downtime due to spindown
   - Solution: Use paid tier ($12.50+/month) or implement keep-alive
   
2. **Redis in Production**: Free tier limited to 20MB and 20K commands/sec
   - Solution: Upgrade to paid Redis for production usage
   
3. **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier limited to 3 nodes and 512MB storage
   - Solution: Use paid tier for production data
